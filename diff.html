        <h1>The Differences between XR and other Virtual Simulation technologies</h1>
        <p class="textStyleAndShadows2">As eXtended Reality combines the features of AR, MR, and VR technologies into one single technology term, they are almost indistinguishable between the differring types of virtual simulation technologies that are currently in use. However, there are still key differences between the three technologies in many terms other than being on-par with these types of technologies.</p>
